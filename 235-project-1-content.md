## Genre

## Story
Your kingdom is under attack by a rival king and his army. You, the king, must raise your defenses by building structures like weapons and walls over multiple rounds to thwart his invasion.

## Aesthetics
### Graphics
Cartoonish European middle-ages themed graphics.
### Sound
Cartoon-y sound. Music will loop in the background, and various sound effects will play; i. e. building sound when making structures, sound
of enemies charging, woosh of catapults and arrows, ticking of timers during build phases.

## Gameplay
### Mechanics
The game will alternate two phases: Building Phase, and Enemy Wave Phase. During the build phase, the player will have a certain amount of
money they can spend on building the following defensive structures:
- **Wall**: Stops most enemies from progressing unless they have a siege engine.
- **Archer Tower**: Targets enemies individually and shoots them with arrows.
- **Catapult**: Launches rocks that can hit multiple enemies at once.
- **Moat**: Slows enemy movement significantly.

During the enemy wave phases, a number of different kinds of enemies will spawn on one side of the screen and march to the other to
attack your castle:
- **Soldiers**: Normal troops.
- **Horseback Troops**: High movement speed.
- **Siege Engine**: Knocks walls down, does more damage to your castle than other troops.

Defeating enemies will give you money to buy more structures. Survive ten enemy waves and you win!
### Controls
Mouse to select buildings and place them.
### Teaching the Game
There will be a tutorial screen that will teach the player how to play.
### Player Learning
The player will need to learn how to efficiently use their money to build the best defenses. They'll have to learn which defenses do
best in which situations to manage the number and types of enemies they face.
